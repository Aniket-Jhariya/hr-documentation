## Reports

The `Reports.js` file serves as a placeholder for a future feature in the CandidHR application. It displays a message indicating that the feature is "Coming Soon" and will notify users once it is available.

- **File Path:** `\hr-frontend\src\components\reports\Reports.js`

### Functions and Methods

- **Purpose**:
    - Renders a placeholder UI for a feature that is not yet available.
- **Return Value**:
